# Codewars-Katas

Codewars is a community driven platform of logical programming problems in varying languages and difficulties.

The difficulty system is simple yet abstracted through an odd naming scheme.

Each problem is called a **kata**.

Each **kata** has a difficulty value called its **kyu** with a number associated with it.

The difficulty ranges from **8 kyu** (easiest) to **1 kyu** (hardest). 

Completing **kata** raises your overall honor and rank.
